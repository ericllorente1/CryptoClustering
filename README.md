## About 


## Visualization and Data 
![](Starter_Code/elbow_curve_original.png)

<br> After visualizing the elbow curve for the original data, we can observe that the optimum number of clusters is 4. <br/>

<br> Here we can observe the how the data predictions are clustered. Group 1 and 3 are easily visible. <br/>
![](Starter_Code/elbow_curve_pca.png)
<br>Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we can observe that 4 is the optimum amount of clusters even when the features are reduced to 3. <br/>

![](Starter_Code/scatter_pca.png)
<br>Based on the PCA we get clusters that separate in a quadrant pattern and more visibly distinguished. <br/>

<br>In our example, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the best method to build a model to predict the changes for the cryptocurrencies. <br/>
